    <h1>Dear Zeinab,</h1>
    <p>
      So I did a little digging and I found the perfect book that talks about all these figures from arab history. It’s attached below in the first link (I know you hate digital reading but if you ever feel like it). I also attached the book which I want to read next actually: Life of Pi. I love stories where the hero survives against all the odds.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wanted to wish you a happy birthday from the bottom of my heart and to tell you that I’m so proud of you. You passed through a difficult period and you are going to overcome it and that was never in doubt. I want you to remember to celebrate the fact that it’s been another year of you being a hard and successful worker, a wonderful sister and daughter, and an incredible friend. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I remain so grateful for you, for your presence in my life, and for our ability to be there for each other. I promise that no matter what life does with me I will always be there to the best of my ability.
    </p>

    <p>
        Love,
    </p>
    <p>
        Karim
    </p>
